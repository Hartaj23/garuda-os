# Engineering Document Hierarchy

The engineering governance documents shall be read in the following order.

## Governance Documents

| Document | Purpose | Change Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | AI engineering operating manual | Rare |
| `GARUDA_CONTEXT.md` | Current repository state | Every sprint |
| `GARUDA_WORKFLOW.md` | Engineering lifecycle | Rare |
| `GARUDA_GLOSSARY.md` | Canonical terminology | Occasional |
| `GARUDA_NAVIGATION.md` | Repository navigation | Rare |
| `PROMPTS.md` *(optional)* | Reusable AI prompt templates | Occasional |

---

## Level 1 — Constitutional Authority

- GAR-INDEX
- GAR-0001 through GAR-0024

**Purpose:** Defines what Project Garuda is.

These documents are the highest architectural authority.

---

## Level 2 — AI Engineering

- `AGENTS.md`

**Purpose:** Defines how AI engineers behave.

Read before performing any work.

---

## Level 3 — Repository Context

- `GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`

**Purpose:** Defines the current repository state.

Read before planning or implementation.

---

## Level 4 — Engineering Workflow

- `GARUDA_WORKFLOW.md`

**Purpose:** Defines how work progresses through planning, implementation, testing, review, and release.

---

## Level 5 — Canonical Terminology

- `GARUDA_GLOSSARY.md`

**Purpose:** Defines the canonical language of Project Garuda.

---

## Level 6 — Repository Navigation

- `GARUDA_NAVIGATION.md`

**Purpose:** Defines the engineering document hierarchy and repository entry point.

---

## Level 7 — AI Prompt Library

- `PROMPTS.md`

**Purpose:** Defines reusable AI engineering prompts.

---

## Level 8 — Engineering Document Templates

- `templates/`

**Purpose:** Defines reusable planning, review, closure, and release document templates.

**Templates:**

- `templates/mission-specification.md`
- `templates/implementation-plan.md`
- `templates/approval.md`
- `templates/architecture-review.md`
- `templates/completion-report.md`
- `templates/release-notes.md`
- `templates/sprint-closure.md`

# Repository Authority

When conflicts exist:

1. Constitutions
2. Approved Sprint Documents
3. Committed Repository State
4. `VERSION`
5. Release Documentation
6. `GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`
7. `ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE_v1.0.md` *(frozen baseline)*
8. Other Engineering Documentation

---

# Repository Bootstrap Sequence

Every AI engineer shall begin with [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md), then initialize work using the following order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`
3. `GARUDA_WORKFLOW.md`
4. `GARUDA_GLOSSARY.md`
5. `GARUDA_NAVIGATION.md`
6. Applicable GAR Constitutions
7. Approved Sprint Mission

Implementation shall not begin until this sequence has been completed.

---

# AI Engineer Workflow

```
Open Cursor
↓
Read AGENTS.md
↓
Read GARUDA_CONTEXT.md
↓
Read Mission
↓
Produce Plan
↓
Wait
↓
Approve
↓
Implement
↓
Review
↓
Commit
```

Complete the repository bootstrap sequence before beginning this workflow.

Never begin implementation before approval.

Do not begin the next mission automatically.

---

# Maintenance Policy

Update this document only when:

- repository structure changes
- governance documents change
- engineering workflow changes

Do not record repository state here.

Repository state belongs only in `GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`.
