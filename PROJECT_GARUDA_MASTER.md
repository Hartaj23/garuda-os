Project Garuda Master Architectural Reference

Version: 1.0

Last Updated: 2026-07-06

Document Owner: Project Garuda Engineering Governance

Status: Living architectural reference — not a constitutional document

# Document Authority

This document is the **single architectural reference for onboarding and continuity** in Project
Garuda. It synthesizes vision, status, architecture, history, governance, and roadmap context for
new architecture threads, human architects, and senior contributors.

**It is not the supreme source of truth.**

Authority order:

1. GAR Constitutions (GAR-0001 through the latest approved GAR document)
2. Approved Sprint Documents
3. Committed Repository State
4. [`VERSION`](VERSION)
5. Release Documentation
6. [`GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`](GARUDA_CONTEXT.md) — live operational state
7. This document and other Engineering Governance documents

When this document conflicts with GAR Constitutions or committed repository state, the higher
authority wins. Part IV contains executive summaries only — never substitutes for full GAR text.

# Part I — Executive Overview

## Vision

Project Garuda is a **constitutional operating system for intelligent autonomous systems** — an
Operating System for Human Intelligence.

Garuda is not an application, a trading system, or a single AI product. It is a platform for
building deterministic, reviewable, service-independent cognitive infrastructure through
constitutional engineering.

## Mission

Build Project Garuda correctly — preserving architectural integrity above implementation speed.

The objective is not to generate code. The objective is to construct a durable platform where every
foundation is deterministic, every sprint is constitutional, and every implementation is
reviewable.

## Philosophy — Constitutional Engineering

Project Garuda follows **Constitutional Engineering**:

- Architecture always precedes implementation
- Correctness always precedes speed
- Determinism always precedes convenience
- Every implementation must be reviewable
- Every change must preserve prior foundations
- AI agents are implementation engineers — not architects

Architecture may evolve only through approved constitutional documents and approved sprint missions.

## Why Garuda Exists

Human intelligence operating at scale requires more than models and applications. It requires:

- Stable object identity and lifecycle
- Deterministic serialization and validation
- Descriptive contracts that do not smuggle in runtime behavior
- Cross-foundation compatibility
- Governance that survives team and tool changes

Garuda provides the platform layer for these capabilities without binding to vendors, services, or
deployment targets.

## Long-Term Vision (5–10 Years)

Garuda aims to become a complete cognitive operating system — from universal objects through memory,
knowledge, context, reasoning, decision, action, and execution — extending toward orchestration,
persistence, and autonomous operation **only through approved constitutional evolution**.

No long-term capability in this document authorizes implementation. Future phases require GAR
constitutions and approved sprint plans.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Determinism | Identical inputs produce identical outputs |
| Immutability | Value models do not mutate after construction where designed |
| Platform neutrality | Independent of vendors, services, and deployment targets |
| Service independence | No application-specific or infrastructure-specific behavior in foundations |
| Architecture first | Design before code; stop on ambiguity |
| Certification | Cross-foundation interoperability verified before release |
| One mission, one commit | Reviewable, traceable delivery units |
| Preserve foundations | Every new layer builds on all prior layers |

## Roles

| Role | Holder | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Founder & Vision Holder | Hartaj Sahdra | Vision and project direction |
| Chief Systems Architect | ChatGPT | Architecture, sprint design, constitutional review |
| Principal Implementation Engineer | AI Coding Agent (Cursor) | Approved-scope implementation only |
| Source of Truth | Git repository | Committed state, tests, documentation |

## AI Workflow

Every mission:

```
Mission Specification → Implementation Plan → Architecture Approval
→ Implementation → Testing → Documentation → Verification
→ Architecture Review → Commit → Completion Report → Stop
```

Implementation agents: [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md). Architecture threads: Part XII of this
document.

## Testing Philosophy

- Every mission writes tests
- Deterministic behavior verified through unit tests and certification suites
- Complete non-backend suite run before mission completion
- Repository foundation and toolchain validation mandatory
- Failures reported honestly — never suppressed

- **Foxtrot** — Workspace (process-local)
- **Golf** — Platform integration certification
- **Hotel** — SDK documentation
- **India** — Sprint closure and release preparation

# Part VIII — System Roadmap

**Important:** Future phases described here are architectural placeholders only. No phase beyond
Phase 1 authorizes implementation without approved GAR documents and sprint missions.

## Phase 1 — Cognitive Foundations (Complete)

```
Platform Core → Memory → Knowledge → Context → Reasoning → Decision → Action → Execution
```

| Milestone | Sprint | Release | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository platform | GAR-SPRINT-0001 | `v0.1.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Platform Core | GAR-SPRINT-0002 | `v0.2.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Memory | GAR-SPRINT-0003 | `v0.3.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Knowledge | GAR-SPRINT-0004 | `v0.4.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Context | GAR-SPRINT-0005 | `v0.5.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Reasoning | GAR-SPRINT-0006 | `v0.6.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Decision | GAR-SPRINT-0007 | `v0.7.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Action | GAR-SPRINT-0008 | `v0.8.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Execution | GAR-SPRINT-0009 | `v0.9.0-alpha` | Complete |
| Engineering Governance | GAR-SPRINT-0009 | — | Complete |

## Phase 2 — Not Defined in Repository

Purpose, dependencies, expected outcomes, and sprint estimates for Phase 2 require Chief Systems
Architect authorization. GAR-SPRINT-0010 planning is the next approved activity — specification not
yet in repository.

**Status:** Awaiting approved sprint mission specification.

## Phase 3 — Not Defined in Repository

Future platform capabilities (persistence, orchestration, runtime execution, services layer) may
appear in Phase 3 only through constitutional evolution. No Phase 3 scope is authorized from this
document.

**Status:** Not planned in repository.

## Phase 4 — Complete Garuda Operating System

Long-term vision: a complete constitutional operating system for intelligent autonomous systems.

**Status:** Vision only — not authorized for implementation.

## Dependency Rules

- Every foundation inherits Platform Core object identity, validation, and serialization contracts
- Every foundation preserves all prior foundations unchanged
- Cross-foundation coexistence verified in each Golf certification mission
- Contracts are descriptive — they never invoke runtime behavior in current releases
- Workspaces depend on their foundation's core object but remain process-local and non-persistent

# Part X — Current Priorities

> **Live operational state:** [`GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`](GARUDA_CONTEXT.md) is authoritative for
> day-to-day status. This section is updated at release milestones.

## Today

```
GAR-SPRINT-0009  →  Complete  →  v0.9.0-alpha tagged
        ↓
GAR-SPRINT-0010  →  Planning  →  Awaiting mission specification
        ↓
Mission Alpha    →  Not authorized
```

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Current release | `v0.9.0-alpha` |
| Completed sprint | GAR-SPRINT-0009 |
| Next sprint | GAR-SPRINT-0010 |
| Next mission | Not specified |
| Implementation authorized | No |
| Architecture authorized | Awaiting Chief Systems Architect instructions |

## Immediate Actions Available

1. Approve GAR-SPRINT-0010 mission specification
2. Commit uncommitted governance files (`BOOTSTRAP.md`, navigation updates) if desired
3. Tag missing releases (`v0.7.0-alpha`, `v0.8.0-alpha`) if retrospective tagging is approved

# Part XI — Lessons Learned

Institutional wisdom from nine sprints of constitutional engineering.

## Why Constitutional Engineering Works

Separating **what** (GAR Constitutions) from **how** (Engineering Governance) from **when**
(Sprint missions) prevents architecture drift. Implementation engineers cannot accidentally
redesign the system because architecture changes require explicit constitutional approval.

## Why Deterministic Architecture Matters

Every foundation produces identical outputs for identical inputs. This enables certification,
reproducible tests, and reviewable commits. Non-determinism would make cross-foundation
certification meaningless.

## Why Governance Was Separated from Architecture

`AGENTS.md` and the GARUDA handbook govern engineering behavior without modifying constitutional
law. Engineering Governance v1.0 could be established during Sprint 9 without reopening GAR-0001
through GAR-0016.

## Why Every Sprint Ends with Certification (Golf)

Golf missions add no production functionality. They prove that the new foundation coexists with
Platform Core and every prior foundation. Certification failures block release.

## Why Every Mission Ends with Review

Architecture review confirms scope compliance, constitutional compliance, and repository health.
Mission India adds release documentation only — no code changes — preserving the integrity of
Alpha through Hotel work.

## Why Mission India Is Documentation-Only

Release preparation must not introduce last-minute code changes. VERSION, CHANGELOG, release notes,
and closure reports are the only Mission India deliverables. Tests and packages remain unchanged.

## Why One Mission, One Commit

Traceability. Every commit maps to exactly one approved mission. Reviewers can audit scope by
reading a single diff.

## Why AI Agents Are Implementation Engineers

Architecture invention by coding agents caused drift in early AI-assisted projects. Garuda assigns
architecture to the Chief Systems Architect and implementation to Cursor/Codex-class agents with
explicit approval gates.

## Why Workspaces Are Process-Local

Persistence introduces storage architecture decisions that belong in future approved sprints.
Process-local workspaces prove object identity and reference operations without premature
infrastructure commitment.

## Why Contracts Do Not Execute

Strategy, chain, index, and query contracts describe structure. Execution behavior belongs in
future runtime layers approved through separate constitutional and sprint processes. Mixing
description and execution would violate foundation boundaries.

# Part XII — Bootstrap for New Threads

## For Architecture Threads (ChatGPT / Human Architects)

**Start here:**

1. Read **`PROJECT_GARUDA_MASTER.md`** (this document)
2. Read [`GARUDA_CONTEXT.md`](GARUDA_CONTEXT.md) for live state
3. Read applicable GAR Constitutions (external)
4. Read approved sprint mission specification when available
5. Wait for founder direction before generating new architecture

Do not repeat historical discussions unless needed. The repository is the source of truth.

## For Implementation Threads (Cursor / AI Coding Agents)

**Start here:**

1. Read [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md)
2. Complete the seven-step bootstrap sequence
3. Read approved sprint mission
4. Produce implementation plan
5. Wait for architecture approval
6. Implement only approved scope

## Role Boundaries

| Role | May Do | Must Not Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chief Systems Architect | Design sprints, missions, constitutions; review | Implement production code |
| Implementation Engineer | Implement approved scope; test; document | Invent architecture; skip approval |
| Founder | Vision; approve releases and direction | — |

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Local development setup (not AI bootstrap)
make bootstrap

# Full validation
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_checks.py

# Complete test suite
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover tests
```

---

# Document Maintenance

| Part | Update Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| Part II, Part X | Every sprint / release |
| Part V, Part VI | At sprint completion |
| Part VIII | When architect approves roadmap changes |
| Part I, Part XI | Occasionally — architect/founder |
| Part IV | When GAR documents change |
| Part III, VII, IX, XII | Rare |

Version 1.0 target expansion: deepen Part IV GAR summaries, Part VIII phased roadmap, and Part V
foundation chapters toward 40–60 pages as approved content becomes available.
